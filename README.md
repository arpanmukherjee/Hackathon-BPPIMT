# Hackathon-BPPIMT
The web based application was developed during the hackthon of B.P Poddar Institute of Management and Technology.  

The problem statement is already included and we solved the problem 6. Using google map api user pinned multiple positions where that user want to go. After fetching co-ordinates from google map api,we stored them as 2-D Matrix having a co-ordinate as (x,y). For the shortest distance we implemented classical Travelling Salesman Dynamic problem and calculated the minimum path. Later UI and result was implemented using Django framework.
